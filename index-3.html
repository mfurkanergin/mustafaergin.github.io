	The first personal computer offered for sale is Programma 101 produced by Italian company Olivetti. The project started in 1962 and in 1965 the production process was completed and the production capacity reached large amounts. When it was released the sale price of the Programma 101 was 3,200 dollars, which is equal to today's dollar value 23,000 dollars. 40 thousand units were sold and 90 percent of sales were made in the United States.<br>
	NASA has used more than 10 Programma 101 to use the calculations required for the Apollo 11 to land on the moon. The processor frequency of the Apollo 11 computer, which carried the first man to the moon, was only 1 Mhz. Today, aside from the best computer processors, even mobile phones' processors are faster than 1 GHz (1000 Mhz).<br><br>

	Historical development of the computer has continued in the following years and the old computers in the size of the room have shrunk in time and started to enter our pockets today.The progress has been steadily increasing, and the best computer processor of the time has come to the side not to be looked at after a while. The first computer used in Turkey was the IBM 650-Data, which was brought to the country in 1960 to be used in the General Directorate of Highways.<br>
